## About me

My name is Nastya, I am a last year student.   
I am quite a creative person that's why I decided to choose a development. There are many ways in which developers can be creative: you need to be able to put yourself in the users’ shoes in order to provide a solution, you need to create new systems and functionality and you get to play around and learn new technologies. 
 And I hope that your school will help unleash my full potential.
